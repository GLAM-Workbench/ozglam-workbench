    "## About this project\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade I've created and shared a wide variety of digital tools, examples, tutorials, and datasets. Some like [QueryPic](http://dhistory.org/querypic/) and [TroveHarvester](http://timsherratt.org/digital-heritage-handbook/docs/trove-newspaper-harvester/) are fairly polished and well documented. Others are just fragments of code. All of them are intended to support research into our rich cultural collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even though something like the TroveHarvester is pretty easy to use, it does require a bit of set-up, and I've been very aware that this can be a barrier to people starting their explorations. I created the [dhistory](http://dhistory.org/) site many years ago to provide the foundation for a digital workbench, but I couldn't quite achieve what I wanted – tools that were easy to use and required minimal setup, but also tools that exposed their own workings, that inspired novice users to question and to tinker.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we are. My plan is to use Jupyter, GitHub, [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to bring together all those tools, examples, tutorials, and datasets in a way that supports people's explorations through digital GLAM collections. I'm really excited, for example, that I can create a notebook that provides a [deconstructed (or perhaps see-through) version of QueryPic](Trove/Cookbook/DIY QueryPic.ipynb) – that enables you to build, step by step, the same sort of visualisations, while learning about how it works. And at the end you can download the results as a CSV for further analysis. I love the way that Jupyter notebooks combine learning with real, live, digital tools and methods. You don't have to read a tutorial then go away and try to follow the instructions on your own. It's all together. Live code. Real research. Active learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most of my projects this is in itself an experiment. I'm still learning what's possible and what works. But I'm hopeful."

    "## Running these notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access these notebooks in a number of different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. View on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the contents on [GitHub](https://github.com/wragge/ozglam-workbench), but note that these will be static versions so you won't be able to run any of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Run locally with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed, you can clone this repository, and then run Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/wragge/ozglam-workbench.git\n",
    "cd ozglam-workbench\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Run online with MyBinder\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a live version without installing any software, try [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/): \n",
    "\n",
    "[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wragge/ozglam-workbench/master)\n",
    "\n",
    "MyBinder launches the notebooks in a custom computing environment with all the software you'll need pre-installed. But note that these environments aren't persistent, so you'll need to make sure you download any data you want to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Run locally with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "I've created a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/wragge/ozglam-workbench/) that includes these notebooks and all the necessary software. Assuming you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, just open up a terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "docker run -it --name=Workbench -v WorkbenchData:/home/jovyan/workbench -p 8888:8888 wragge/ozglam-workbench\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a persistent data volume and runs the workbench image. Once Jupyter starts up it'll display a url in the terminal that looks something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=262718512d11cc3efcb1b2878f4jja9uca071924e328d554\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just copy and paste this into your browser to open the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To restart the `WorkBench` container using the same data volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "docker start -ai Workbench\n",
