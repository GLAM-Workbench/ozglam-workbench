    "The Trove Newspaper Harvester is a command line tool that helps you download large quantities of digitised newspaper articles from [Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/).\n",

    "Instead of working your way through page after page of search results using Troveâ€™s web interface, the newspaper harvester will save the results of your search to a CSV (spreadsheet) file which you can then filter, sort, or analyse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better, the harvester can save the full OCRd (and possibly corrected) text of each article to an individual file. You could, for example, collect the text of thousands of articles on a particular topic and then feed them to a text analysis engine like [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) to look for patterns in the language.\n",

    "It's important to note that there are currently a few differences between the indexes used by the web interface and the API, so some queries won't translate directly. For example, the `state` facet doesn't exist in the API index. If you use the `state` facet the TroveHarvester will try to replace it with a list of newspapers from that state, but there are now so many newspaper titles that this could fail. Similarly, the API index won't recognise `has:corrections`. However, most queries should translate without any problems.\n",
